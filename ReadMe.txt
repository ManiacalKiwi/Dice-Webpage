Created web page based off of wireframe submitted earlier. Included png's of dice for the dice selector portion and buttons for future links but had issues with the positioning on the page. Eventually I would like the page to be functional enough to actually be able to roll dice though I am aware that it is outside the scope of the class I think I will put in time to learn how I can add those elements to the page for the experience.
UPDATE: Changed color of header and footer to UAT themed.
Added a JavaScript for dice rolls using chatGPT's help to format the formula to roll dice and add up the results.
